A powerplant engine( gas-turbine) is mainly used to generate electricity. Since the engine can different types of fuels, the engine can have different levels of CO2 and NO emission gases.
This dataset is generated from a gas turbine in Turkey. More info:

What you can do with this dataset:

You can create a regression model to generate the level of Carbon monoxide (CO) and Nitrogen oxides (NOx).
You can also find out which features are most correlated to CO2 and NO
